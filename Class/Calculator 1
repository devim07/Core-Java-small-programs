/*Create a new class called Calculator which contains the following:
A static method called powerInt(int num1,int num2) that accepts two integers and returns num1 to the power of num2 (num1 power num2).
A static method called powerDouble(double num1,int num2) that accepts one double and one integer and returns num1 to the power of num2 (num1 power num2).
Call your method from another class without instantiating the class 
(i.e. call it like Calculator.powerInt(12,10) since your methods are defined to be static) 
Hint: Use Math.pow(double,double) to calculate the power.*/


import java.util.*;
class Calculator
{    
	static int powerInt(int num1, int num2){
		return (int)(Math.pow(num1, num2));
	}
	
	static double powerDouble(double num1, double num2){
		return Math.pow(num1, num2);
	}
}

class Test{
	public static void main(String[] args)	{
		System.out.println("2 raised to 3 = "+Calculator.powerInt(2,3));
		System.out.println("2.5 raised to 3.5 = "+Calculator.powerDouble(2.5,3.5));
