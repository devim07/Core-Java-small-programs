/*
Accelerate the Car
a) Create a new Java class named Car that has the following private fields
 year The year field is an int that holds a car's year model (e.g. 2010)
 make The make field is a String object that holds the make of th e car (e.g. "Porsche")
 speed The speed field is an double that holds a car's current speed (e.g. 25.0)
b) In addition, the Car class should have the following methods
 Constructor The constructor should accept the car's year , make , and beginning speed as
arguments
 These values should be used to initialize the Car's year, make, and speed fields
 Getter Methods Write three accessor ( getter ) methods to get the values stored in an object's fields
 accelerate Write an accelerate method that has no arguments ( parameters) passed to it and adds
1 to the speed field each time it is called
 For example: if the car was going 3 mph , accelerate would set the speed to 4 mph
c) Write a separate java class RaceTrack in a separate file with a main() method that
 Create a new Car object (using the Car constructor method), passing in the year, make, and speed
 Display the current status of the car object using the getter methods getYear (), getMake (), and
getSpeed
 Call the car's accelerate method and then re display the car's sp eed using getSpeed
