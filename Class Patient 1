/*Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics. 
Here’s what the class should do:
Construct a class called Patient
Store a String name for the patient
Store weight and height for patient as doubles
Construct a new patient using these values
Write a method called BMI which returns the patient’s BMI as a double. 
BMI can be calculated as BMI = ( Weight / ( Height in meters x Height in meters ) )
Next, construct a class called 'Patients' and create a main method. 
Create a Patient object and assign some height and weight to that object. Display the BMI of that patient.*/
